Hi, I am Emek 👋  
Senior Backend Engineer with 15+ years of experience building backend systems that scale, evolve, and survive production.  
Favourite question is "**why?**".  

I care about domain correctness, architecture tradeoffs, and shipping software that survives real users.  
I enjoy event driven systems, backend architecture, and pragmatic use of ML when it actually adds value.

### Featured Projects

• ♦️ **Texas Hold’em Critter (WIP)**  
A Texas Hold’em poker simulation built to explore event sourcing and domain modeling using Marten and Wolverine (Critter Stack). Focuses on invariants first, aggregate boundaries, and long running workflows instead of UI or shortcuts.

• 🔥 **Aspire Forge**  
A Bash based project bootstrapper I use to start new services with my preferred structure and tooling. Built to remove repetitive setup work and enforce consistency across projects.

• 🔐 **BG Challenge**  
A system design challenge exploring how to build a reliable job queue on top of PostgreSQL, using advisory locking for concurrency.

• 🏪 **FakeStore MCP**  
An e commerce demo integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Next.js and the FakeStore API using strict TypeScript. Demonstrates protocol driven design and real client server boundaries.

• 💱 **Currency Converter API**  
A production style C# API built with vertical slice architecture, resilient HTTP calls using Polly, and proper test coverage. A simple domain used to showcase clean vertical slice backend design.

### What I Actually Work With

C#, .NET, APIs, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, CRUD, event driven architecture, DDD, CQRS, Marten, Wolverine, Docker, Azure  
Python for ML experiments when it makes sense

### About Me

I have led teams, mentored developers, shipped systems at scale, and worked as a founding engineer in early stage startups.  
I prefer small teams, high ownership, and environments where thinking matters more than process.
